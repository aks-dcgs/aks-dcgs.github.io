    <td>For the last two weeks in IT we have been learning how to use Google Sheets effectively. We have been learning to make a Virtual Shop. Surprisingly not much of it depended on V-LOOKUPS. Instead it was basic arithmetic. We had a stock list and the costs. The most challenging problem of making the Virtual Shop was making the discounts work. It wasn't working because I had put too many brackets in my expression. My discount would happen if the customer bought five or more items and then they would get 40% off for all of their items. </td>
