The Sorting Hat, Micro:bit lesson 2

In this week's IT lesson we looked at making the sorting hat from Harry Potter. We made them on Microsoft touchdevelop. After we had made it work MrKeen told us to do it with our houses at school. We also had to fill in a small sheet on what the commands ment. 

Our homework was to make it on javascript at first it looked really hard but now I Am gradually getting the hang of it
