    <td>Repl.it is a coding website. In this week's lesson we were learning basic python and logic. We started off with a simple 'What is your name'. Here we used different commands such as strings and variables. After we did this we did something saying ‘Are you good today (your name)’. This used strings and inputs. After this we then went on to make a multiple choice question. This used .lower which meant whatever answer they put, it would automatically be turned into lower letters. This also meant we gave the user a choice which meant if they didn't use yes or no it would repeat the question.</td>
