Microbit Game lesson 2

In this week's IT lesson we carried on with our microbit games. Firstly I had to fix my blog as it had a page build error. Mr Keen showed me how to fix it. I had colons in my titles which made the blog break. So that is why my blog posts are in a random order. In the IT lesson Aidan and I were trying to fix are game yet again. We couldnâ€™t figure it out in class so we did it for homework as well as a blog. We figured out how to do it as Mr Keen briefly explained it in class. So we figured it out and it is working a game.

WWW: We figured out how to fix problems again.

EBI: Try and do more next lesson.
