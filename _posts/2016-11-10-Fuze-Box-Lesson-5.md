Fuze Box Lesson 5

In this week's IT lesson my partner and I carried on through our Fuze Box manual. We carried on through section 2. There was one assessment which was a little bit to do with siri. We thought we could improve this by making it with our own names. This is what the code said.

Hey, I'm Siri. Please enter your name.

(You enter your name, however if it isn't my name it will sayâ€¦)

Access denied.

We are hoping to code it so that you can make an account and login.

WWW: We have finished the first step of it.

EBI: Keep up the good work.
