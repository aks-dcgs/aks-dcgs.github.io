    <td>As my target for the lesson was to do 5%more in Codecademy Python, I really pushed myself to finish the section I was on. The section I started with was Conditionals and Control flows. I was on the last exercise of it and I managed to quickly finish it. I think the box in the top right hand corner of the screen is very helpful as when I got stuck on exercises I would just look to there and it would tell me what I've done wrong and what line the mistake was on. </td>
