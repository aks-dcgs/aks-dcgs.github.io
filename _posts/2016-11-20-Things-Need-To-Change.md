Instead of doing Fuzebox this week Mr Keen called us into his room for a blog mid point review.

Mr Keen showed us an example of one of the blogs in his class he said it needed a better background but the content was ok. We looked at another one which looked a lot better and intriguing. But this second blog was so much better than my one. So I learnt that my blog needed a lot of fixing.

Mr Tansley said that he would show us how to change our backgrounds and everything else.
