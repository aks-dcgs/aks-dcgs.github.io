**_Summer's over..._**

**Hello again internet! Today was the first IT lesson after the summerâ€¦ so it was a shame to have the shock of school after holiday, but the lesson was quite good. We came in and re-learned how to set up our fuse box (mini computer), so we managed to set it up a lot quicker this week :  ).**

**We then went onto the Raspberry Pi, which is a coding software. We then started to code the "Hello World" task, which is just a task to get us to learn the basics. In this tutorial, we got the computer to type Hello World, but we didn't get it to stop typing those two words. Once we had stopped it repeating itself, we learnt how to change the font colour, and then the background behind the font.**

**In this lesson, we progressed through the task quite quickly, and I think that all of my group understood what we were doing. I also learnt lots of useful new things.**

**_EBI_**

**I think that the only improvement that we could've had was getting on to the next task, and also perhaps getting set up quicker.**
