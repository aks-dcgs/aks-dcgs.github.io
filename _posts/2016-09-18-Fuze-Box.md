Fuze Box

In this week's IT lesson we started to use a technology called fuze box. We were given all the components and we plugged them into our monitors. We will be working through the booklet for the next couple of weeks. My partener and I finished the first exercise which was to get to grips with the code that fuze box uses. We figured out how to change the colour of the background and the writing, the amount of words spaces and no spaces and much more. We had to save our work onto a USB stick as this wasn’t a programme you could save on your computer desktop. I enjoyed using fuze box this week and I can’t wait to do some more on it.

WWW: We finished the first exercise in one lesson.

EBI: Don't take too much much time saving our work.
