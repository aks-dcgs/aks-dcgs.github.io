    <td>Instead of doing Codecademy Mr Keen was testing our knowledge on Python. We had to make a function that can figure out the area and perimeter of any shape. In the lesson I struggled  a lot however when I was at home I managed to figure it out. 

I also managed to get up to battleship on Codecademy which is 57%.</td>
