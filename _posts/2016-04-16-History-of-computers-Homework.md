 The History of Computers Homework

In this week's IT lesson we looked over one of the homework pieces done over half term. This one was done by Jeremiah (a boy in my class) his one was really good and we went through each stage and talked about the good things and the bad things. It was a really good presentation and there weren't many bad things to say about. After Jeremiah’s Prezi we looked at not such a good one. There were grammar errors, it wasn’t spaced out, some of it was copied and pasted.

WWW: I thought that I listened in very well and answered quite a few questions.

EBI: Keep up the good work.
