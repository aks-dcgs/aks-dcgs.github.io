Year seven wasâ€¦ GREAT!

In year 7, I was quite happy with my IT work. I was quite good at getting my homework in on time, and understanding/listening to the work set. My weaknesses were knowing when to ask for help - sometimes I sat there for ages, having given up, instead of trying to work it out, or asking for help. I also got distracted a bit once I'd finished my work, instead of asking for an extension, or something else to do. My targets for this year are:

To ask for help when I need it.

To ask for an extension when I've finished my work.
