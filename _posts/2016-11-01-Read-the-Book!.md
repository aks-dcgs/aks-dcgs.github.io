**_Read the Book!_**

**In today's IT lesson, we carried on with our coding project. My group were a bit behind, because we were fixing our blogs last lesson. Our activity was to learn about and use strings, which are bits of text. However, we didn't get past Step three, because we accidentally missed out a page in the Book, meaning that the code was always wrong ;  ).**

**We did eventually realise what we were doing wrong, but it was a bit too late in the lesson to do much about it.**

**We should've read the book properly! We also got a bit impatient with each other, which slowed down our progress a lot.**
