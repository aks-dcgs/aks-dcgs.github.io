Fuze Box Lesson 2

I n this week's IT lesson we did some more work on fuze box This time me and my partener di assessment 2 which we finished in the lesson we managed to save . Assessment two was about adding and subtracting on fuze box. We found it quite easy but there were a few difficulties with copying things down. We didn't get much done on assessment 3. I hope we can finish assessment 3 in our next lesson IT
