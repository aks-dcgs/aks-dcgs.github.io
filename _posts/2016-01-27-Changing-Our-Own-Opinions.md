Changing Our Own Opinions

This week in IT we looked at media and how other people can change our own opinions. Mr keen did a survey from his notebook and there were questions like "Do you regret anything you put up online". The middle of the room is if your neutral and, the side closest to the board was yes and the one nearest the painting was no. If most people were on one side and there were only a few people on the other side, the people on the fewer side changed sides.

WWW: I think I answered a lot of questions.

EBI: To stick to the side that I was on.
