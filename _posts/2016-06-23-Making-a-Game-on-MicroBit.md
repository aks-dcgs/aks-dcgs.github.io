**Making a Game on Micro:Bit**		

In this week's IT lesson we started making our own games in Micro:Bit. We had to start off with the first bit of the game and we got stuck. We had to make the Micro:Bit take off a point when you get a question wrong. The way we did was is to have a global equals button with the globals adding and minusing something. We tested the workâ€¦ and it worked !. Now we had to move onto the second part of the game which is to make it so if you get past one question you press A+B to get onto the next question. This part of the game was fairly easy. We left it there and will do more next week.

WWW: We worked out problems on ourselves without asking Mr Keen to help us.

EBI: Carry on working like this.
