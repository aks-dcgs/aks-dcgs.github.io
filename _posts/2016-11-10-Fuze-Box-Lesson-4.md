Fuze Box Lesson 4

In this week's IT lesson my partner and I finished the whole of chapter 1. Firstly we had to finish assessment 4 which taught us how to make a tiny space invader appear in the top left hand corner of our screen, it was quite short and very easy to follow. Assessment 5 was making another space invader appear next to the other one. Again they were easy instructions to follow. 

WWW: We're on chapter 2

EBI: Try to get a decent amount of assessment 2 done.
