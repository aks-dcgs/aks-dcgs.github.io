Being Careful of when you post things online

In this week's IT lesson we looked at a series called "First to a Million", it was made by CEOP.

It was about a girl called Aleeya and a boy named Tariq. They were talking about getting a million hits on their channel. But Aleeya's brother,Jamal, wanted to get to a millon first and it turned into a competition.

At the end of each video it would be your choice to see what happens next. The last video was to really test you. The majority of the people said yes and Mr keen said they were breaking the law.

You can test yourself if you got to youtube and type in First to a million and see what happens. Our homework this week was to go on the think you know website and have a look around.

WWW:I thought I participated well in the lesson.

EBI: Try to keep us this standard.
