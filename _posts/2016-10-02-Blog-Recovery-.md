**BLOG RECOVERY**

**HELLO again internet! In today's IT lesson, I didn't actually do any coding, because my blog didn't work, so I spent the whole lesson trying (and failing) to fix it. In the end I had to just make a new blog, with my year 8 posts.**

**WWW**

**What went well was that by the end of the lesson, I had a new, fully working blog!**

**EBI**

**If I'd made the new blog quicker, then I could've got on with some coding. The rest of my group could've done a bit more work while I was fixing my blog.**
