In this week's IT lesson we changed the font of our writing and the background colour. 

First we signed into Github and at the same time opened our blogs. We then went to our settings and checked if there was anything wrong with our websites. After this we went to style. ssc and we went to body background and it came up with a hash code.  To change this we went to W3schools and looked for html colour picker. We were then able to choose a colour and it came up with the hash code so we used that and put it in.

Then we went to our blogs and clicked refresh and voila it had changed the background colour!

I don't think I made any mistakes in this lesson and I performed very well.

Next time maybe choose better colours :)
