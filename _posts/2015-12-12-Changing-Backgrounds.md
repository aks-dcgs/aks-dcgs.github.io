In this week's It lesson we changed the font of our writing, background colour. 

First we signed into Github at the same time open our blogs. Then we went to our settings and checked there was anything wrong with our websites. After that we went to style. ssc and we went body background and it came up with a hash code to change this we went to W3schools and looked for html colour picker. Once we found it we choose a colour and it came up with the hash code so we used that and put it in.

Now we went to our blogs and clicked refresh. It had changed the background!!!!!!!!!!!

I thought i made no mistakes in this lesson and did really well

Next time maybe choose better colours (:
