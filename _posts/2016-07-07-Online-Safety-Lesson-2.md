Online Safety Lesson 2

In this week's IT lesson we talked about revenge pornograghy.  Firstly we talked about how people get images of each other in a relationship. But when the couple splits up one of them can blackmail the other into doing something or they they will post a picture of them. Then we talked about being sent a dirty image from a friend or you have done something wrong yourself. Mr Keen said come to me or tell your parents straight away. If it is really bad it may go to the police. Our homework was to a blog post.
