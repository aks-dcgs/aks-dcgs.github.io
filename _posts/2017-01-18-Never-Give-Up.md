    <td>Today we looked at a video of a young Japanese boy who was in a gymnastic show. It was his turn to vault over the block. His first try failed and his teacher sent him to do it again. He tried, but again failed. He started to cry . All of his teammates made a circle round him saying 'You can do it, You can do it'. Now on this next attempt he makes it over with ease. I find this very inspirational as it inspires me to never give up no matter what.
