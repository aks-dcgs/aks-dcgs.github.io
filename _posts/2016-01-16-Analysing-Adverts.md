In this week's IT lesson we analysed an advert.

The advert was about the Kia Slove it was compared to Three hamsters from there old fat bodies to their fit and smart ones. This compares to the Kia Slove because the advert is saying upgrade to the new car .

We watched it once to get the jist of the story. Then we watched a second time and Mr Keen told us to look more closely at each individually frame. Once we had finished the second round. The whole class discussed what was happening in the advert.

Our homework is to read a document on google classroom and the second piece is to answer three questions about an advert you have seen.

I thought nothing went wrong in this lesson and I understood what was going on.

I think I could of put my hand up a bit more in that lesson.
