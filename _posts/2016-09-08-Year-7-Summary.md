Year 7 Summary

When I had my first IT I didn't know what to expect. Luckily we were doing Scratch I had done Scratch at my old school. I found Scratch quite easy. IT started getting hard when we started making blogs. I had trouble making it but after I was ok. Mr Keen was a great teacher. IT at my school is now very different to when I was in Primary school. I have really enjoyed IT so far and I hope to see more exciting things along the way. I also really enjoyed microbit programming as well.
