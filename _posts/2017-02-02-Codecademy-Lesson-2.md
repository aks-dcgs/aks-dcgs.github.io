    <td>As we were doing Python I was quite used to the terms it was using. I got stuck on one of the stages and I straight away looked in the top right corner of the screen. That told me what the problem was. I managed to get to 19% of Python and our homework was to do 5% more. At home I managed to get to 23% and at school next week my target would to be get 5% more again.</td>
