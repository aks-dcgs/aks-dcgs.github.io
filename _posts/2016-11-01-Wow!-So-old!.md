**Wow! So old!**

**In today's IT lesson, we did some more coding using our fuse boxes. My group were a bit behind, as we missed a lesson due to our blogs having to be fixed. By the end of the lesson, we had got the programme to ask what our names were, what our favourite hobbies were, and how old we were. When we answered how old we were, if we were under 10, it would say that we were very young. When Mr Tansley tried it, and said he was over 10, the computer exclaimed: Wow! So old!**

**WWW**

**We worked well as a team, and got the activity done quite quickly and efficiently!**

**EBI**

**At first, we had some difficulties working together, but eventually sorted them out. If we had sorted the problem out sooner, we might've got onto the next task.**
