First Lesson

What We Did

In this lesson we started on making our own blogs. First we made a github account. It asks for a username, email and a password. After this we searched 'Jekyll'. There were loads of different ones we chose ?barryclark?. Once we had this we had to fork it (make a copy). Normally it would come up with verify email address so got to your mail and open the email after that click verify once. Go back to github and fork it again. After this go back and click settings and you can write your username.github.io (e.g aks-dcgs.github.io). Once you have done that then you need to get gabriel and fill in everything and accept everything. Then you can type your username.github.io and it should come up

What went well

I thought I did ok in this lesson. My blog is up and running so I'm really happy

What didn't go so well

I found it a bit hard to do the second step and get the website address. But I got there in the end
