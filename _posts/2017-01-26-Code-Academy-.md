    <td>We first had to log into codecademy using our google accounts so that is would save our progress. Mr Keen told us to click on the python project. Code Academy explained how to use python very well as their were different stages. Some stages were quite hard and I took a bit of time coming off them. It taught us about variables, math, strings and many others. I think codecademy is really good for people who want to learn how to code and if you want fix your code.</td>
