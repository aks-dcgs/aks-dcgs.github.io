Micro:bit

In this week's IT lesson we looked at the BBC micro:bit. The micro:bit is a really fun piece of tech to work with you can out code onto it so if you shake it, it will come up with a number. Mr Keen showed how to script it and then we, again, played around as we did with Prezi. Sadly we didn't have any micro:bits so we couldn't transfer the data off the computer onto the micro:bit.

At first micro:bit looked really hard but as I went through the tutorials it became much more easier
