    <td>I think I need to think of what I'm going to do a lot quicker because if I had thought of Tennis then I could have done much more in the lesson.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>

    <td>Definitely think beforehand. Think of an idea while listening to the teacher and then once I'm sent back to my desk I know what I'm going to be doing.</td>
