    <td>My partener and I started on exercise 2.1 and finished it with ease. We copied the code down and tested it to make sure it worked. After we tried to change it by adding a security question. It was "What is your name" and if you typed in yours it would say “Access Denied” however if you used my name or my partner's name it would say “Access Granted”. We then moved onto exercise 4.1 which was using the breadboard on the monitors. Also in the lesson we fixing our blogs as well.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think we needed to focus more as we kept on coming off and onto the fuzebox. I feel we were getting a bit annoyed with ourselves as we were trying to fix the wires onto the breadboard. I also think because we didn't focus that was the reason why we were having trouble with the wires and where to put them.
