Fuze Box Lesson 3

In this week's IT lesson my partner and I finished assessment 3 which means we only have 2 more assessments to do. Assessment 3 was quite easy and we followed the instructions with ease. It was all about writing dialogues and making questions up and answering them. Again we started the next assessment but we only wrote a bit and then it was the end of the lesson and we had to save our work and turn off our machines.

WWW: We went through assessment 3 easily

EBI: Try and finish the whole of chapter 1 in the next lesson
