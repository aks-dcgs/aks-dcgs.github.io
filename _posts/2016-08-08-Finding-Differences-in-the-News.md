**Finding Differences in the News**

For our Summer Holidays homework we had to find differences in the news. I was finding differences between BBC News and Al Jazeera. I found that they both have the same news. They say the same things about the certain event but some statistics were a bit different. For instance in the Pakistan bombings the BBC said there were 50 killed but Al Jazeera say at least 45 a small difference.

WWW: I found the websites with ease.

EBI: I could of found the differences a bit quicker.
