**_What We Did_**

**In this lesson, my group and I got through the next activity in the fuse workbook very quickly. The programme used lots of different commands, but we mainly learnt about how to use variables more efficiently. This is an extract from the code:**

IF guess < number THEN result$ = " too low"

IF guess > number THEN result$ = " too high"

**This helped us understand how to use variables, as the ****_result_**** variable showed us how to make the computer say different things without using Print.**

**_WWW_**

**My group and I got through our task VERY quickly, and we all contributed equally and effectivley. There were no arguments between us, and it all flowed through very well.**

**_EBI_**

**Something that would've helped us is that we couldâ€™ve taken turns reading, using the mouse and typing, because at times each of these activities were quite boring.**
