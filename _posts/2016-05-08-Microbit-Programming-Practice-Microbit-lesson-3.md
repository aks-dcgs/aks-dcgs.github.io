Micro:bit Programming Practice, Micro:bit lesson 3

In this week's IT lesson we looked at three different codes on javascript. The first one was Roll the Dice. It gave us the instructions for the basic roll the dice but for the extension we had to make the numbers look like how they would be on a normal dice. 

After that was recipe 2 Mood Swings. In this piece of code we had to make it so that if the Micro:bit was faced away it would be a sad face if it was near us it would be happy and if it was somewhere in the middle it would be neutral. The extension was to see if when the Micro:bit was sad make the brightness dim and when it was happy make the brightness brighter.

I'm about halfway through recipe 3 and it is quite tough. Our homework is to do half an hour more on micro:bit

WWW: I think that I got a reasonable amount of work done.

EBI: Carry on like this.
