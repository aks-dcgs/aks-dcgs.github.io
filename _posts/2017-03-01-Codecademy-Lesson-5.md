    <td>In Python you have to finish a section to get 5%more on it. I was on avery long section of Python. I did some at home but I finished it off at school. I think having the box in the top right hand corner is really helpful as when I got stuck, I would always look to the box and it would tell me what I did wrong. Also now that I'm focussing more I get huge amounts done in lessons. Codecademy is gradually getting harder however now Iâ€™m getting better at the different techniques in codecademy.</td>
