Videos

In this week's IT lesson  we looked at two videos.

The first one was about what happens when you've forgotten your phone. It was about a lady who, without her phone couldn't speak to anybody. There was one scene where herself and her friends were around a table at a cafe once something had popped up on Facebook or Twitter etc, her friends were all sitting on their phones and not talking to each other. I think Mr Keen showed us this video because it shows how much social media can change you. 

The next video was a Twitter musical. There were a group of friends singing about Twitter. One person said "Also you can take random pictures of your feet !". But there was one person who wasn't so happy with her friends on their phones. When the friends starting telling her about Twitter she immediately changed, and started singing along. Mr keen told us that this was made by disney because the girls were wearing dresses the looked exactly like Cinderella, Bell and Snow white. Also it was a really annoying song but it was so catchy.

WWW: In the first advert I answered a lot of questions.

EBI: I think in the Twitter advert I could've put my hand up more.
