This week's IT lesson we looked at the Advantages and Disadvantages of Social Media. For instance a disadvantage would be you can post fake images of yourself. This can lead to child pawning or grooming or some nasty and unpleasant things can happen to you. Most of the things in social media are bad. An advantage would be you can get information a lot quicker. 

WWW: I thought I understood everything Mr Keen was talking about.

EBI: I could have interacted with the lesson a bit more.
