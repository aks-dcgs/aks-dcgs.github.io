    <td>We first learnt about the definition of Boolean. Boolean is only yes or no answers. We then learnt about binary and different bases such as Base 10, Base 16 and Base 2. We started off by converting binary numbers into base 10 numbers. Then we looked at bits and bites. We watched a video about storing thing in bits and bites(It was about how gangnam style broke youtube). Gangnam Style had over 2 billion views.</td>
