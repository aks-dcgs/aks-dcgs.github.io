    <td>For the past four weeks we have been learning about coding on Google Sheets. We were learning about having our own coded languages and making our own coded messages

Firstly we had to think of a keyword and then write the alphabet in order after. We put this vertically down column two and put the normally alphabet in cell one and in cell three so the keyword was basically surrounded by the alphabet.

Next we used vlookup which is a function that uses our keyword and our alphabet and translates into normal letters for instance if i put the letter C the vlookup would put underneath A depending on how far you have shifted your letters.</td>

    <td>I found it quite difficult to start with but when I started to understand it became very easy and also with the help of my teacher I was able to make a very well functioning coding sequence. Also I need to ask more questions and try and answer more and not get easily distracted.</td>
