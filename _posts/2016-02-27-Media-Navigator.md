Our homework for half term was to create an identity map about ourselves. This map contained many things to do with us. It was quite hard to think of a layout for the identity map but I got their in end. With each picture I drew there was some writing underneath. I feel it went very well.

I was ok in sharing my identity map with the class because it had information about me and I wasn't sure how they would act. I thought some may laugh or be surprised about some of the things I wrote. But I got really good comments from my classmates.

I felt it was a better way to give feedback. Also they were anonymous so we could say what we like. This was better because we can say what we really truly feel. I also liked it better because we could find out more about each other and we get to see other people's ideas.  

I enjoyed this way better because when we do it in front of the person's face in class sometimes we may lie to make them feel better about themselves. Here we could say what we wanted to, but there was only one rule no swearing.

I felt very happy with all my comments most of them were colourful, informative and A...MA...ZING. I was surprised that they were all so good. I don't think there were any bad comments. I was worried about how big the writing was.

This process is very different because at school you can recognise some of the handwriting, also you can count back the class to see who has written what. But on social media someone can write a really mean comment and their tag name could be "happy.person.7". Also the person could be lying about their identity.

My identity map helped to create a sense of what I want to post in the future a lot. It showed me not to post my special events, or stuff to do with my family or my interests and my culture.

I'm not going to make huge changes to the media I use because I donâ€™t post anything I would regret about. I normally post funny pictures with captions.

These six lessons helped me a lot to understand more about social media. We didn't go through it that much at my old school, however these six lessons helped me to know if there are people trying to track you like pedophiles and rapists. I also learnt not to put up so much information about yourself and the advantages and disadvantages of having social media.

Some bits of it because I was thinking of posting things when we were on holiday but now that we have learnt about people trying to track you down I have thought about it a bit more.

Mr Keen has done very well to get this across to us and the lessons have been very fun as well !
